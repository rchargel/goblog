<p>For some reason, I have found it necessary on multiple occasions to build the same code to look up 
states/provinces given a country name or identifier. This is tedious to write, and there should 
really be someone who has already done this, but I haven't found a good (and free) solution for this. 
I considered trying to figure out some way to use Google's Geolocation APIs to get around this problem, 
but I decided to marry my love of Wikipedia and Groovy, and just put together a couple of REST services 
deployed to <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>.</p>


<p>I am currently considering how to allow other people to update/add information, or just get some 
ideas on improving the functionality. Stil, it was a fun way to spend a weeks worth of train rides.</p>
