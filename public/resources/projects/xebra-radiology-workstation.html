<p>Xebra is an open source, cross-platform, thin client and server for web-based distribution and 
clinical review of medical imaging results. Xebra is based on the latest open industry standards 
including JPEG2000, WADO and IHE XDS-I.</p>

<p>This project was built using the <a href="http://www.dcm4che.org/">DCM4Che</a> library.</p>

<p>The company that sponsored Xebra has since been purchased, and the Xebra project has been abandoned. 
It is my intention to eventually revive the project if I can get some funding to do so.  We were at one 
time the #1 downloaded medical technology on Sourceforge.</p>
