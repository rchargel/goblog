<p>This is one of the few publically available websites I built (most of my work exists behind firewalls). Since I am not a web 
designer I don't feel too bad about saying that.  I built it with jQuery, and it is backed by my 
<a href="/proj/json-wordpress-theme">JSON WordPress Theme.</a>
That thing that looks like a Flash animation, is really just javascript.</p>

<p>I have to say, the piece that I am most proud of here is the Javascript image gallery that I wrote for the site.  
If you go to the "Projects" link on the left, then click on any of the menu items at the top (Campus, Community, 
Historic, or Urban), an image gallery will load in the main page.  I was actually inspired by a few different 
image galleries I saw online.</p>
