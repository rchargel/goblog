<p>This is a JSON theme for wordpress. It essentially turns your wordpress server into a 
series of AJAX calls. It cannot be shared as a regular wordpress theme as it contains no HTML in its output.</p>

<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>

<p>This really could not be any simpler. Download the source:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">git clone git@github.com:rchargel/json-wordpress-theme.git json-wordpress-theme</code></pre>

<p>This will create a directory in the current folder called 'json-wordpress-theme'. Enter that 
directory, and you should see this README file, and another directory, with that same name: 
'json-wordpress-theme'. Just zip up that directory, and you have the theme ready to install.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">zip json-wordpress-theme.zip json-wordpress-theme/*</code></pre>

<p>Now just log into wordpress and install it like any other theme.</p>

<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>

<p>At this time, I have only deployed this theme in my own website. It is not really ready for production release. 
I know of at least two bugs.</p>

<ol>
	<li>The RSS feed will not work with these URLs.</li>
	<li>For some reason, only the default permalink format will work when fetching data: eg: /wordpress/?p=post_id</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, you will not be able to preview your pages, as all you will see is the JSON that is created.</p>

<p>Thanks and have fun with it.</p>
