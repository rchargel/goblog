<p>I have been asked recently how long it took me to become comfortable developing a web site in WordPress. 
"No time at all," I might say, but it really depends upon what specifically you are looking to learn. The 
person who asked me this was on the fence about hiring a developer to manage their WordPress site. The 
developer they were looking at had plenty of PHP experience, but had never used WordPress. What I 
explained to her was that WordPress is like any other technology. It comes with a learning curve, albeit a 
particularly shallow one, but it follows the same principals that all well written software frameworks 
follow. Once you've seen one, you've seen them all.</p>

<p>In the specific case of WordPress, if you have no web development background it will probably take you a 
day or two of playing around with the features before you figure out what everything does, and how it works. 
You should be able to start downloading themes and plugins by your second day playing with the software, and 
if you're feeling a little adventurous, maybe even tweaking the themes a little.</p>

<p>If you have a little background in PHP, you should be able to copy somebody else's theme as a starting 
point to develop your own themes fairly quickly. You will probably spend a day or two figuring out how the 
WordPress themes are constructed (they are essentially a ZIP file with a manifest). And how to add extra 
features like a search page.</p>

<p>If you have more than just a little background in PHP, it shouldn't take you long to start writing plugins.</p>

<p>PHP is not the language that I use in my professional life, and while I have been writing web applications for 
the past 17 years, I have probably used PHP for those projects four or five times. Even with that limitation, it 
took me three days to download WordPress, install it for the first time, and build my 
<a href="/proj/json-wordpress-theme">JSON WordPress theme</a>.</p>

<p>This is not an ad for WordPress, and I am not trying to sell anyone on its use. However, I think that it is 
important for hiring managers to understand that development is more than just putting in a bunch of catch 
phrases on your resume. When looking for a developer, don't focus on specific technologies, but rather focus on 
their general aptitudes and attitudes towards development. It is more important that they understand your 
business and your business's online strategy, than whether or not they used X or Y technology in their last 
project.</p>
