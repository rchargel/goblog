<p>Java 8 was <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8/">released on 
March 18, 2014</a>. There are many cool new features to the language in this 
release, however talking about each of them would take much more time than I 
can allot to a single post. So I am focusing on one of my favorite new features,
the lambda.</p>

<p>When Java 7 was first proposed, there was a lot of talk about including 
closures into the spec. Unfortunately, the rumors turned out to be false, and 
Java 7 was released closure free.<p>

<p>While technically not a closure, the lambda feature introduced in Java 8, 
is a major leap forward. So, what is the difference between a lambda and a 
closure? It may be easiest to think of a lambda as a type of closure. In Java 
8, the lambda is essentially a less verbose way of defining an anonymous inner
class. When you think about it, an anonymous inner class is itself a closure.
The only real difference is that you must define the entire class as a method
of defining a single function.  Lambdas work exactly the same way, except 
without the need for all that verbosity.  So let's take a look at a simple 
lambda expression.  Let's say you wanted to filter a given collection of 
<code>Employee</code> for those employees in a given department.  You might 
start with code that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="java">Collection&lt;Employee&gt; employees = ...
final String department = "IT";
// create an anonymous inner class for Predicate
CollectionUtils.filter(employees, new Predicate&lt;Employee&gt;() {
    @Override
    public boolean evaluate(Employee employee) {
        return employee.getDepartment().equals(department);
    }
});</code></pre>

<p>Not so hard, but still, it seems a little tiresome to build an entire 
Predicate class, just to filter a collection. So here's another approach:</p>

<pre><code class="java">Collection&lt;Employee&gt; employees = ...
final String department = "IT";
// lambda for Predicate
CollectionUtils.filter(employees, e -> e.getDepartment().equals(department));</code></pre>

<p>Wasn't that so much nicer?  The lambda expression will get converted by the 
compiler into an instance of the anonymous inner class.  Nothing crazy is 
happening here. You are just implementing the interface Predicate with a single
line of code. This works because Predicate is a very simple interface with a 
single method, and Java is littered with just that type of interface.  This also
means that you could define a reference of Predicate using a lambda, and pass it around.</p>

<pre><code class="java">Collection&lt;Employee&gt; employees = ...
final String department = "IT";
Predicate itDepartment = e -> e.getDepartment().equals(department);
CollectionUtils.filter(employees, itDepartment);</code></pre>

<p>Of course if you're really going for Java 8, you probably should just use 
the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html">Stream 
API</a>:

<pre><code class="java">Collection&lt;Employee&gt; employees = ...
final String department = "IT";
// lambda for stream
employees.stream().filter(e -> e.getDepartment().equals(department));</code></pre>

<p>So, you'll probably notice that the lambda expression was able to access the
local variable <code>department</code>, but just like an anonymous inner class, 
the local variable must be <code>final</code> or effectively final.  This is where
lambdas differentiate from true closures. A closure is not a pure function, as it
has side effects. It fully encloses the scope of the calling function and can 
modify the value of local variables; lambdas cannot do this.</p>

<p>One more thing about lambdas, they can implement any interface with a single 
method, regardless of how many parameters taken in that method.</p>

<pre><code class="java">public class Calculator {
    interface Operator {
        int operation(int a, int b, int c);
    }
    public void calculate(int a, int b, int c, Operator o) {
        System.out.println(o.operation(a, b, c));
    }
    public static final void main(String ... args) {
        Operator addition = (a,b,c) -> a + b + c;
        Operator product = (a,b,c) -> a * b * c;
        new Calculator().calculate(1, 2, 3, addition);
        new Calculator().calculate(1, 2, 3, product);
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>I do mean any number of parameters.</p>

<pre><code class="java">public class Calculator {
    interface Operator {
        Integer operation(Integer ... numbers);
    }
    public void calculate(Operator o, Integer ... numbers) {
        System.out.println(o.operation(numbers));
    }
    public static final void main(String ... args) {
        Operator addition = n -> Arrays.asList(n).stream().mapToInt(a -> a).sum();
        Operator product = n -> Arrays.asList(n).stream().mapToInt(a -> a).reduce((a, b) -> a * b).getAsInt();

        new Calculator().calculate(addition, 1, 2);
        new Calculator().calculate(product, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>For my next post I'll talk about mixins and how the new multiple inheritence 
works in Java 8 (and how they solve the diamond problem). Here's a sneak preview:</p>

<pre><code class="java">public class Calculator {
    interface Operator {
        int apply(int a, int b);

        // is this an implemented method in an interface?
        default Integer operation(Integer ... numbers) {
            return java.util.Arrays.asList(numbers).stream().mapToInt(a -> a).reduce((a, b) -> apply(a, b)).getAsInt();
        }
    }
    public void calculate(Operator o, Integer ... numbers) {
        System.out.println(o.operation(numbers));
    }
    public static final void main(String ... args) {
        Operator addition = (a, b) -> a + b;
        Operator product = (a, b) -> a * b;

        new Calculator().calculate(addition, 1, 2);
        new Calculator().calculate(product, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    }
}</code></pre>
