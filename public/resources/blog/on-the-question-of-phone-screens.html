<p>
  Okay, so I have already written a blog post about <a href="on-the-question-of-interviews">interviewing candidates</a>.
  So why am I writing another post on the very same topic? One simple reason, I am tired of wasting valuable resources in on-site
  interviews with candidates who can clearly not code their way out of a paper bag. I literally saw this in a Java code test
  a candidate was taking:
</p>

<pre><code class="java">1. public class Person implements Comparable {
  ... // getters and setters
2.   public int compareTo(Object obj) {
3.     Person person = new Person(this.firstInitial, this.lastName);
4.     if (person < obj) {
5.       return 0;
6.     }
7.     return 0;
8.   }
9. }</code></pre>

<p>Shall we break this down:</p>
<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <dt>Line 1</dt>
    <dd>No generics: <code>Person</code> should implement <code>Comparable&lt;Person&gt;</code>. Eclipse gave him
        the brackets, but he didn't
        know what to do with them so he just deleted them. This isn't a knew thing, we've had generics in Java
        since JDK 1.5, released in 2004.</dd>
    <dt>Line 2</dt>
    <dd>Once again, this should have been <code>public int compareTo(Person other)</code>.</dd>
    <dt>Line 3</dt>
    <dd>Um... what? Why would you instantiate a new person with the same information of the current person?</dd>
    <dt>Line 4</dt>
    <dd>Probably my favorite line of code I've ever seen. It didn't seem to bother him that it wouldn't
        compile, but he didn't seem to realize that he was trying to compare the reference values, not the contents
        of those two objects.</dd>
  </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
  This was only the beginning of the debacle that was that interview. At the end of the day, the real failure here was
  that everybody's time was wasted. This candidate should never have spent his afternoon driving to our office, and
  I should have been doing more important work. The poor guy should have been weeded out by the phone screen process.
  For the sake of full disclosure, I have been guilty of clearing candidates during the phone screen, that later
  completely bombed their code tests.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, I did not have a good answer on how to better determine a candidate's qualifications during a phone screen.
  So I did what any reasonably intelligent person would do; I asked Google. What I eventually found was a blog post
  by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/blog-rants">Steve Yegge</a>,
  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/five-essential-phone-screen-questions">The Five Essential
  Phone Screen Questions</a>. I found this to be a great guide to phone screening, however I feel that the author
  of this post is a little harsh and also misses one big area.
</p>

<p>
  I'm not going to bother summarizing his post, but Steve Yegge offers up the proposition that there are five
  essential areas wherein <em>all</em> developers must be fluent.
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Coding</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Object Oriented Design</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Scripting and Regular Expressions</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Data Structures</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Bits and Bytes</strong></li>
  </ol>
  I think that he is mostly right, but I also think that some of his requirements are arbitrary. Furthermore, most
  people are unprepared for a long phone screen, and the post does not describe how to keep the phone call to under 45
  minutes.
</p>

<p>
  So this post is an attempt to write a flexible script, with just a few questions, which can be covered within 30 minutes.
  This script should probably not be used verbatim, but as a rough guideline on how to conduct a phone screen. That said,
  as Yegge explains in his post listed above, it is important not to allow the candidate to control the
  conversation. If they begin to drone on, and attempt to steer you into some friendly banter about the virtues
  of checked vs unchecked exceptions, interrupt and get things back on track.
</p>

<p>
  The following is a list of questions that I believe should be asked, and in the order in which they should
  be presented. Ordering is important because each question builds upon the expected understanding of prior questions.
  Also, if the candidate fails to correctly or satisfactorily answer one, the interview should
  be terminated in a friendly manner. Do not continue to the next question, just say "Thank you for your time, those are
  all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me?" Furthermore, it should be noted that the dialogs
  presented below are all real conversations that I have had with real candidates, though not necessarily during phone
  screens. Unlike many other blogs on this topic, I am presenting only conversations that went well, as
  there is no need to drag you through a list of absurdities.
</p>
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p>
  The first question should be just as Yegge suggests, a simple function that demonstrates the candidate's ability
  to think in code. My preference is to use non-arbitrary actions, unlike his example of calculating the n-th Fibonacci number. First, because
  people expect (and may have memorized the solution to) the Fibonacci calculation, nor does it really
  evaluate a real-world task. Also, the question
  should be something that you as the interviewer could answer in less than 5 minutes. Please do not expect people
  to actually give you completed code, as many candidates are not sitting at a desk during a phone screen. Some people,
  God forbid, prefer to be screened during their lunch breaks at their current job, and don't have pen and paper at hand.
</p>
<p>
  So here is an example of a simple question and answer.
</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight"><b>Me:</b>   How would you write a method that takes a String
      parameter, and returns a copy of that String with the
      characters in reverse order?
<b>Them:</b> I would just use StringBuilder's reverse method.
<b>Me:</b>   Good answer, but what if that was not available?
<b>Them:</b> Then I would create a for loop that started with <em>i =
      string.length() - 1</em>, counts down and continues until
      <em>i &gt;= 0</em>. Inside the loop I would call <em>string.charAt(i)</em>
      and append that to a variable that was declared
      before the loop.
<b>Me:</b>   Awesome, but how would you append it?
<b>Them:</b> If I could use StringBuilder, I would use that.
      Otherwise, I would just keep adding it to the end of
      a string. The compiler will optimize it anyhow.
<b>Me:</b>   Even if the compiler can't determine the final length
      of the string?
<b>Them:</b> Good point, I'm not sure.
<b>Me:</b>   That's okay, you've thought about it. What would you
      do if you were reversing an integer instead of a
      string?
<b>Them:</b> Hmm..(pause) I would use a modulus of 10 and keep
      dividing the input by 10 in order to step through the
      digits.</code></pre>
<p>
  Those are good answers which lead to follow-up questions. It didn't take more than
  a few minutes, and I did not expect the candidate to know more than they had pretensions
  of knowing. For instance, I would not have asked the question about compiler optimization
  if the candidate had not brought it up. The fact that they even consider how the compiler
  treats their code is a bonus, and extra kudos are apportioned if they know exactly how it
  works. Even more kudos are offered if the candidate points out edge cases (eg: what if
  the string input is null, or if the integer ends in zero?).
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, while the candidate might be expecting a question about string reversal, and could
  have prepared for it, throwing in the last bit about reversing an integer forces
  them to think a little harder.
</p>
<p>
  Again, if they cannot answer this question, or they refuse on principle, thank them for
  their time, and end the call.
</p>

<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p>
  Okay, he or she can write and think in code. Now we should see if they understand how databases
  work. If your project does not use relational databases, feel free to skip this question.
  That said, even if your project uses noSql datastores or if you're doing everything through
  an ORM, I believe that it is important to understand how to do basic SQL queries.
</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight"><b>Me:</b>   Okay, I have a database with two tables: Person and
      Address. The Address table has a Person ID field. What
      is the relationship between the two tables?
<b>Them:</b> You mean like one-to-one, one-to-many, that sort of
      thing?
<b>Me:</b>   Exactly.
<b>Them:</b> It's potentially one-to-many, a person could have more
      than one address, but an address has only one person.
<b>Me:</b>   Great, now how would you write a query that gets all
      of the people and their addresses from the database?
<b>Them:</b> I suppose I would use a join.
<b>Me:</b>   Would it matter if not everybody had an address
      record?
<b>Them:</b> Yes, then you would need an outer join.</code></pre>
<p>
  See, that wasn't so bad. The real life candidate in this case did need a little prodding, as
  she did not seem to know what I was driving at with my second question, but the whole dialog
  took about 5 minutes.
</p>

<h3>Question 3</h3>
<p>
  Hey, if they know SQL they should understand data models. For this question, I am including
  two dialogs. The first dialog was a good response, the second was a great response.</p>
<p>Dialog #1</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight"><b>Me:</b>   I am writing a simple employee tracking application.
      This application needs to track employees, their hours,
      salaries, addresses, and managers. Can you give me an
      example data model?
<b>Them:</b> Okay, I would have an Employee class with salaries as a
      field. It would also have a list of Address objects and
      a field for the manager, which is just another employee.
      For the hours you would need another class that mapped
      the employee to the date and number of hours worked on
      that date.
<b>Me:</b>   Great, now what if I had volunteers who also had hours,
      but no salaries? How would I tell the difference.
<b>Them:</b> I would add a field with an EmployeeType enum. That enum
      would have something like Staff and Volunteer.
<b>Me:</b>   What if I also had board members? They have addresses,
      but they are not employees. They don't have hours,
      managers, or salaries.
<b>Them:</b> Maybe I would create a Person class, and Employee and
      Board member would extend Person.</code></pre>

<p>Dialog #2</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight"><b>Me:</b>   //same question as above
<b>Them:</b> I would start with a Person class and create an Employee
      that extends that.
<b>Me:</b>   (interrupting) Why wouldn't you just create an Employee
      class?
<b>Them:</b> Later on down the line we may need users that are not
      employees, but are people. Or some other person type
      that isn't necessarily an employee and doesn't fit that
      mold.
<b>Me:</b>   Awesome, go on.
...</code></pre>

<p>
  Both of these were good responses, but the second dialog showed me that the candidate
  was already thinking ahead to the next problem.
</p>

<h3>Question 4</h3>
<p>
  We're chugging right along now. Now we've determined that the candidate is a fairly
  proficient developer. Before we start asking about data-structures, let's get a better
  view into how well this person understands corner cases and possible bugs.
</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight"><b>Me:</b>   Okay, we're going to change direction a little bit here.
      What is Integer Overflow and what could it do to your
      application?
<b>Them:</b> I don't know what that is.
<b>Me:</b>   Thank you for being honest. How about this, what is the
      maximum value you can put into an int in Java?
<b>Them:</b> Oh, I see. I just never heard that name before. So the
      max value of an int is like 2 billion and something. Or
      really 2<sup>31</sup> - 1. If you try to put something
      larger than that into an int, it will overrun and go to
      the next negative value. So if you add one to the max
      int, it will be the minimum value of an int, negative
      two billion and something.
<b>Me:</b>   Why is this something we should care about?
<b>Them:</b> Well it could totally mess up the math in your code if
      you're dealing with really large numbers.
<b>Me:</b>   How could you deal with this?
<b>Them:</b> Well, if you know it could be an issue you could just
      use a long, or BigInteger if you need to deal with huge
      numbers.</code></pre>

<h3>Question 5</h3>
<p>
  Okay, now we're ready to talk about data-structures.
</p>

<pre><code class="nohighlight"><b>Me:</b>   What data-structure best describes the DOM?
<b>Them:</b> The DOM? The DOM is a Tree.
<b>Me:</b>   Cool, what are some other trees you might normally run
      into?
<b>Them:</b> Well binary trees are used for searching in hash tables.
      The heap is usually implemented as a tree in order to
      manage priority queues.</code></pre>

<p>
  Very simple question, with a simple answer. Doesn't take more than a few seconds, but gives you
  some insight into the candidate's understanding of the underpinnings of how software is built.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  At this point I would ask the candidate if he or she had any questions for me, and start to
  wrap up the interview. I did not ask about previous experience or goals. I just need to find out
  if it's worth bringing this person in for an on-sight interview, where they can talk about
  where they see themselves in five years.
</p>
<p>
  You will also notice that I didn't ask about scripting, or bits-and-bytes, as Yegge suggests. For the former, I don't
  really care whether or not they can write a decent regular expression, Google can help with that. I <em>do</em> think it's important that
  a developer understands the available tools in their ecosystem however, and I would encourage you to ask a
  question that concerns the ecosystem that relates to your organization. For instance, Yegge mentions grep,
  but not everybody has the freedom to work with real operating systems. Some poor souls are forced to deal
  with Windows, and don't have Cygwin for some reason. Another example he gives is asking about text editors
  and the candidate mentions vi, but doesn't know about vim. Okay, that would be a huge red-flag for me (only
  because the candidate brought up vi in the first place). But
  I highly doubt that somebody who can do well with the questions I suggested would be that far off on understanding
  their environment.
</p>
<p>
  As to the bits and bytes, I might argue that the Integer Overflow question covers that as well, but
  there are plenty of simple one-off questions that can be tried. "What is a primitive?" or "When might
  you use bit-shifting?"
</p>
<p>
  Finally, there is one question that I will <em>always</em> ask people interviewing for a Java developer
  position (and I ask it as the first question). "What build framework do you use and explain how it works?"
  I have run into too many Java developers that just know how to use Eclipse and don't understand how to
  actually produce artifacts. I don't care if they tell me that they just have a Make file, or write a shell
  script that produces a war, but if they don't know what I'm talking about, then I end the interview at
  that point. The only exception to this rule is interviewing for interns or junior developers.
</p>
<p>
  Good luck to everyone on this. I know how hard this part of the job can be.
</p>
