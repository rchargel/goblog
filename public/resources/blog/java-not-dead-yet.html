<p>A client of mine sent me a link to an article called 
<a href="http://drdobbs.com/jvm/if-java-is-dying-it-sure-looks-awfully-h/240162390">If Java Is Dying, It Sure Looks 
Awfully Healthy</a> by Andrew Binstock. The gist of the article is that contrary to rumors of Java's pending demise, 
it is still the in the list of most commits and posts on sites like GitHub and technology forums.

<p>It seems to me that the people claiming that Java is dead/dying language fall into three camps. The first camp 
has some vested interest in this claim. The second camp makes a distinction between Java and the JVM. Finally, the 
third camp makes a distinction between the language and its development community.</p>

<h3>Objective-C and .Net</h3>

<p>Companies like Microsoft and Apple have been antagonistic, when not outwardly hostile, towards Java and any 
other language that they viewed as a threat. Certainly, Sun Microsystem's battles with Microsoft are legendary. 
Starting with <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-10-1997/jw-10-lawsuit.html">Sun's lawsuit against Microsoft in 1997</a>, 
they fought a legal war until <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/709519/000119312509126389/ddefm14a.htm">Oracle's 
purchase of Sun in 2009</a>.</p>

<p>Apple has been no stranger to fighting legal battles. In 2010, Apple <a href="http://tinyurl.com/lkmt6f7">deprecated Java</a> on 
the Mac OSX platform. Fortunately, Apple exists completely within their own world, and they don't really care about the 
world outside of their platform. Unless of course you're Samsung.</p>

<p>Both of these companies choose to support their own "native" languages for their operating systems. It makes sense, and 
one can hardly blame them. At least in the case of Microsoft, they also support an open platform with the idea that more 
applications for their OS will benefit their customers, and ultimately make their platform more attractive.</p>

<h3>Programming Languages Don't Die, They Just Multiply</h3>

<p>I believe that there is a time and place for every programming language. Some languages are just better suited to 
certain tasks. Can I write multi-threaded software in C? Yes, but it's difficult (<em>really difficult</em>). Can I solve 
concurrency problems in Java? Most, but languages like Go and Scala were created to solve these problems.</p>

<p>Java has its place. When I want to write an enterprise middle-ware application, Java sounds like a great solution. 
That said, there are just some problems for which Java is not well suited. For instance, when I want to quickly 
prototype a web application, I don't want to deal with all of the ceremony involved with writing a Java app. When I 
want to develop a simple workflow for a web UI, I don't want to deal with a multitude of Spring configuration files. 
I can put together a Rails or Grails app in a fraction of the time it would take.</p>

<p>But Java isn't just a language. Java is also the JVM, and that is really a platform for software development. 
Languages like Groovy, Clojure, and Scala are new tools built on that platform. The addition of these new languages 
running on the JVM, and more importantly, relying on existing projects by the larger Java community, will ensure 
that the Java Virtual Machine (and Java) will continue to thrive. At least for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h3>The Slow Death of the Java Community</h3>

<p>There has been the argument floated that <a href="http://blog.kdgregory.com/2013/07/signs-that-java-is-fading.html">there is 
nothing interesting done in Java anymore</a>. This isn't really the 
same as saying that the language is dying, but it implies that the community is fading. As the development community 
dies out, so does the language. While there are still people writing COBOL, I doubt most of us would consider it a 
viable language to launch a career in software development.</p>

<p>While I have made the argument in the past that finding decent Java developers is far from easy, I don't think 
this is a problem with the community's lack of commitment to the language, but rather a symptom of the popularity of 
that community. I have heard many people say "I would love to code in (insert programming language here), but 
Java pays the bills." When a language becomes the predominant language for enterprise development, it will 
attract a wide array of developers. That includes the rockstars, the mediocre, and even the downright terrible. I 
blame this on corporate cultures that allow bad developers to thrive, rather than the language itself. I think 
that there are still people doing interesting things in Java. Take the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2012/04/Dempsy">Dempsy</a> 
project by my friend Jim Carroll, or just about any project that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Lea">Doug Lea</a> 
is working on. There is a whole community of Java developers just working on issues of Mechanical Sympathy (just google it, 
and count how many of the top posts are Java).</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Java is not dying, nor is the JVM. What <em>is</em> happening is that the community has grown enormous, and that has brought 
with it a number of <em>very</em> uninteresting projects. Every company wants a custom web app to do some trivial part of their 
daily operations. Most of these companies already have a cadre of Java developers. This is just what happens in large 
enterprises.</p>

<p>That said, I would keep my options open. Learn new languages. Try Python and Ruby if you like web development. Learn 
Go if you're interested in concurrency and distributed processing (I wrote this website in Go). Take up new JVM languages; 
I personally have fallen in love with Groovy, and Closure is a fantastic functional language. Keep things interesting. It's 
good for the mind as well as the soul. Too much of "Java pays the bills" and you'll be destined for developer burn out.</p>
