<p>Over the past few weeks I have been put in the not-to-enjoyable position of having to interview a series of 
candidates for a senior engineer posting at my current job. Interviewing potential coworkers is not a simple 
task, and I don't think that I am alone when I say that being the interviewee is often easier than being the 
interviewer.  So, for just these occasions I have always relied on a series of basic programming questions 
to "weed-out" less than great candidates.</p>

<p>In the past, I've avoided riddle questions and FizzBuzz questions, mostly because the former puts a candidate 
on the spot and proves very little, and the latter is just insulting to anyone even remotely qualified. First, 
it's just too easy, but mainly any developer who's ever been to an interview has heard this one.  I might as 
well ask about the difference between a Vector and an ArrayList.</p>

<p>That said, I still think it's important to pose a simple problem to see how a candidate approaches it. Jeff 
Atwood has argued that FizzBuzz is still valid, because 
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html">most programmers can't program</a>. 
Still, I'm willing to 
give people the benefit of the doubt. I've also heard the benefits of the 
<a href="http://www.skorks.com/2010/03/an-interview-question-that-prints-out-its-own-source-code-in-ruby/">quine</a> 
question, but while I think 
that's a fun puzzle, and it's the first program I write after Hello World when learning a new language, I don't 
think it really shows whether a developer knows basic structure.</p>

<p>So I wanted to come up with a list of questions that were as fun as the quine puzzle, and as to-the-point as 
FizzBuzz. Lately I've been using "write a method to parse a string into an integer" then follow up with, 
"now support hex." I like this one because it shows me a) whether the candidate can create a simple loop, b) 
if he/she know basic math, c) whether they take the time to consider error handling, and d) if given the 
opportunity to consider optimization, will they?</p>

<p>There's only one problem I have with this question... so far nobody has even come close. What gets me is 
this was supposed to be my easy question, to get people into groove, and these are supposed to be senior 
developers. Am I being unfair? Should I go back to FizzBuzz? I've never even gotten to 
<a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems">question #22 of 
Project Euler</a>.</p>

<p>I think I might start accepting Integer.parseInt(String) as a valid response.</p>

<p><em>UPDATE:</em> After speaking with some fellow employees, whose opinions I trust implicitly, I have 
decided to bring back the FizzBuzz question.</p>
