<p>I'll admit it. I just might be a Gopher (fan of Go). But is Go really ready for prime-time
development? Instead of simply answering yes or no (which is an impossible task anyhow), I
am creating a list of things I see as the positives and negatives. You are all adults
and can certainly make up your own minds as to the viability of the language for your
own projects.
</p>

<h3 id="what-is-go">1 What is Go?</h3>

<p>Go is an open source programming language developed at Google by programming legends
Ken Thompson, Rob Pike, and Robert Griesemer. It seems to be derived from C, but with
the addition of some support for dynamic-typing, and automatic memory management. The
language library is small, but provides most of the functionality required for everyday
development tasks. Below is a simple go application.
</p>

<pre><code class="go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World")

    var message1 string
    message1 = "Go is statically-typed"
    message2 := "Even if by inference"

    fmt.Println(message1)
    fmt.Println(message2)

    // this won't compile: (mismatched types string and int)
    fmt.Println(message1 + 5)

    // this will work, but the output will be rubbish
    fmt.Println([]byte(message1)) // casting string to byte array.
}</code></pre>

<h3 id="what-i-like">2 What I Like</h3>

<p>Like I said, I very well might be a Gopher. I enjoy coding in this language. It reminds
me of those first days playing with Python. Learning a new programming language is fun, not unlike
learning to speak a human language. With each new language you start with syntax, then move on
to grammar, and finally you learn how to <em>think</em> in that language. I might even venture
to say that learning a new language is like falling in love. So, how much of the gushing that
you are about to read is due to mere fatuation, and how much is from an honest admiration? While it
is true that I am smitten with this language, I'd like to think that I am an objective reporter,
and for all the good things that I have to say about Go, I have included plenty of negatives.</p>

<h4 id="compiler">2.1 Go Compiler</h4>

<p>The Go compiler is fast. Really really fast. If it takes a whole second to compile your
app, there's probably something really wrong with your code. This high compilation speed allows
the team at Google to do some really cool things, like the <a href="http://play.golang.org">Go
Playground</a>. This is a site that allows you to write test code into a textarea, hit the "Run"
button and the web app sends your code to their server. The server compiles your code, runs it,
and returns the output back to you. This happens very fast; the code above compiled and ran, and
the full round-trip to and from the server took 108 milliseconds.
</p>

<h4 id="performance">2.2 Performance</h4>

<p>Like C or C++, Go compiles to native code. There is no VM required, which is good and bad.
Unlike C/C++, Go hides most of the nitty-gritty kernel level code from you. This includes
scheduling tasks for multi-threaded code (more on this later) which was a nightmare to write
in the former languages. I'm not going to claim that Go is the mythical "write once run
anywhere" language, but it's pretty good. Unfortunately, this also means that you have to
compile binaries for every architecure. Here's an <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/pnfwxg">article</a>
on how to cross-compile for other architectures. I have not tried this yet, so I can't speak
for its accuracy or ease.</p>

<p>So is Go as fast as C?. Well... no. Like Java, Go runs a garbage collector. If you're
generating a lot of objects over really short periods, the garbage collector
may slow things down. Here is a <a href="http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/compare.php?lang=go">side
by side benchmark comparison of Go vs C on a single core x86 running Ubuntu</a>.</p>

<p>Okay, so how does it compare with Java? Well, the same site does provide a
<a href="http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=go&lang2=java&data=u32">comparison
between Go and Java performance</a>, and it appears that Go outperforms Java on some tasks, while the JVM
still beats Go soundly at others. But these tests really don't account for anything practical. Here's a better
question. How long does it take to start up a Java application container, like JBOSS, and initialize a Spring web
application? I originally developed this website in Grails (which is essentially a
Spring web application), and deployed it to Heroku. It took an average of 1 minute to spin up the container.
I have since migrated the site to Go, and the average spin up time is less than half a second (neither of these times
include the time to spin up the host).</p>

<p>There are still things you can do in Java and C that you just don't have access to in Go. There are tricks
and gems hidden away in the JVM that allow you to do some really crazy performance tuning of your applications,
but most developers will never use these. Go provides a simple language to build applications
that perform well, without a having to understand the core components and "unsafe" packages of the JVM.</p>

<h4 id="channels">2.3 Go Channels</h4>

<p>A channel in Go is essentially an in-memory blocking queue. These exist in Java (and other languages). That's
not really new or special. But Go's channels are just so easy to use. I went to a conference last year where a
presenter said that Go was a language built to solve concurrency problems. I'm not really convinced that's true,
as Go routines are not inherently thread-safe, but channels make it really easy to "share memory by communicating."
</p>

<p>Here is a simple example.  When the <code>printWordMap</code> function is allowed to run as part of the main thread. it will
print the output of the generated word map. However, if you make that function also run in a go routine, the main method
will print an empty (or partially empty map) and exit the application. Closing the channel at the end of the <code>reaWords</code>
function, does not actually change resource allocations. It is only used to inform any reading threads that they should not expect
any more data to be pushed through the channel, terminating the for loop in the <code>printWordMap</code> function.</p>

<pre><code class="go">package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "strings"
)

func main() {
    channel := make(chan string, 1) // buffer of one
    wordMap := make(map[string]int) // a simple map
    // start go thread
    go readWords(channel)
    printWordMap(channel, wordMap)
    // try it this way instead
    // go printWordMap(channel, wordMap)
    fmt.Println(wordMap)
    fmt.Println("Main Thread Complete, exiting program")
}

func printWordMap(channel chan string, wordMap map[string]int) {
    for word := range channel {
        wordMap[word]++
    }
}

func readWords(channel chan string) {
    var contents = `Some large amount of text should go here. Or better yet, a file should be opened and read.`
    reader := strings.NewReader(contents)
    bufferedReader := bufio.NewReader(reader)
    for {
        line, _, err := bufferedReader.ReadLine();
        if err == io.EOF {
            break;
        }
        for _, word := range strings.Fields(string(line)) {
            channel &lt;- strings.ToLower(word)
        }
    }
    close(channel)
}</code></pre>

<p>Very simple multi-threading with cross-thread communication. Not a lot of boiler plate code.
Here is a <a href="http://play.golang.org/p/Cm6paIAcY_">link to this app in the Go Playground</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-needs-work">3 What Needs Work</h3>

<p>There's plenty more that can be said for all of the great features of Go, but others have written plenty on that subject.
Now let's talk a little about some of the problems I have found. What should make you think twice about
using this language for your own enterprise development.</p>

<h4 id="embedded-resources">3.1 Embedding Resources</h4>

<p>Okay, this first problem is more of an annoyance than a real problem, as there are plenty of
work-arounds.  In Java, if you want to embed a properties file or any other configuration
file this isn't a problem. It gets packaged into the jar, and can be read out of the
classpath.</p>

<p>This is not really possible with Go. The binaries cannot contain resource files. There is a
package called <a href="https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata">go-bindata</a> which can compile
resources as binary data, but it actually just converts the data into a byte array and packages
that array inlined into your code.  The worst part is, the resource data must be completely loaded into memory
before the your code can run. This means that if the data is large enough, it can take an insanely
long time for your application to run; so much for performance.</p>

<p>Like I said, there are work-arounds for this. If you know the file layout, you can simply
read your resource files directly out of the filesystem. Your Go application can read environment
variables to figure out where resource files should be loaded, or you can simply deploy your resource
files in the same directory as your application.</p>

<p>This is an inconvenience, but not a deal-breaker.</p>

<h4 id="implicit-interfaces">3.2 Implicit Interfaces</h4>

<p>Golang does have the concept of interfaces, however their implementation is a little strange. Any type
you create implements a known interface, if it has all of the required method signatures for that interface.
There is <em>no requirement</em> that a type explicitly declares an interface.  This means that I can write
a type call today, and five years later somebody creates an interface with the same, or with a partial list
of my method signatures. Now, without any action from me, my five year-old type automatically
implements the interface defined today. The new developer can cast my old type to his new interface, without
writing any kind of adaptors.</p>

<p>Some of you might be thinking, that's really cool, and I can totally see where that kind of thing might
come in handy. However, there is the possibility that this could lead to unexpected results. Let's say I'm writing
a simple chess game and I define the following type:</p>

<pre><code class="go">package chess

type ChessPiece struct {
   Position PositionOnBoard // defined elsewhere
}

func (c ChessPiece) MoveTo(row, column string) error {
   ...
}</code></pre>

<p>A simple enough type. Perhaps the <code>moveTo()</code> function uses a graphics library to
render the chess piece moving across the screen.  Now somebody a year from now creates the following interface:</p>

<pre><code class="go">type FileSystem interface {
    MoveTo(oldPath, newPath string) error
}</code></pre>

<p>Now my ChessPiece is automatically also a FileSystem.  This is odd, and theoretically someone
could attempt to use my ChessPiece as a FileSystem and get some pretty strange results.  Now, I'll admit
that this scenario is rather contrived. It's unlikely that somebody would load my chess library into an
application that would need the FileSystem interface (unless they are EMACS developers), but there are
scenarios where less divergent, but equally problamatic, pairing could cause problems for developers.</p>

<p>This is still not a deal-breaker for me.  It's not the language developers' responsibility to keep
people from shooting themselves in the foot.  But it's something that nobody seems to be talking much about,
but something that Golang users should really keep in mind.</p>

<h4 id="slices">3.3 Slices Behave Badly</h4>

<p>A slice is a little bit like a Vector or ArrayList in Java. The problem comes when you are
working with multiple slices backed by the same array.  I won't go into too much detail about
this particular quirk, as my friend Keith Gregory has already covered this one in his
<a href="http://blog.kdgregory.com/2013/12/learning-go-slices.html">blog post from December of last
year</a>.</p>

<p>The gist is that a slice will continue to be backed by the same array, until there is no more room
within that array. At this point it will create a copy of the array. If you are working with multiple
slices, all backed by the same array, but you are appending values to one of those slices. Your appended
values will also appear on the other slices. So far that makes sense as you are modifying the same
array. However, once you reach the array's capacity, the Go will create a new array, and associate that
array to the slice you are working with, and <em>only</em> that slice. You have now lost the association
to the other slices. This can be confusing for a developer, and cause serious bugs if you don't know what
you're doing.</p>

<h4 id="deps">3.4 Dependencies</h4>

<p>Google had an interesting idea when they developed Go's dependency management framework. Rather, then
download a binary or have some configuration file, simply include the URL of the source repository as the
import statement. The developer will then call the <code>go get &lt;url_of_repo&gt;</code> to fetch that
dependency, and all of its transitive dependencies. So if you are writing the code below:</p>

<pre><code class="go">package db

import (
    "github.com/jinzhu/gorm"
    "fmt"
)

func OpenDB() gorm.DB {
    db, err := gorm.Open("postgres", "user_info_here")

    if err != nil {
        panic(fmt.Sprintf("Got error '%v' when connecting to the database", err))
    }
    return db
}</code></pre>

<p>You would simply call "<code>go get github.com/jinzhu/gorm</code>" before compiling your code, and
Go will fetch the source from GitHub (also works with Mercurial) and place it into your Go packages.</p>

<p>Sounds kind of cool at first. However, it's important to remember that you are fetching the head
revision of master. You're using the development branch of someone else's code as your production library.
If they check in a change that is not backwards compatible, you will have a broken build. If they delete
or move the repository, you will have a broken build. You as the developer
cannot define that you want to use version "X" of the dependency, which means that you do not have
reproducable builds.</p>

<p>This, in my opinion, is the single greatest flaw of the Golang build process. In order to "fix" this problem
some developers have commited copies of the third party libraries that they use into their own repositories.
This akin to checking in Jar files into your code repositories. It works, but it is really ugly.</p>

<p>In order to fix this problem, Google will need to add some kind of versioning mechanism. This mechanism
must get the required libraries and their versions out of the source code, whether that's from the import
statement alone, or there is some additional configuration file. Perhaps something could be built to wrap the
current build process.  Perhaps they could develop a proxy that intercepted the the <code>go get</code> request
and pulled the required version out of the a config file in the source code. This proxy could act like a Maven
repository. Taking that to the next level, it would be nice to have something like Maven Central, where there
is a list of open-source projects with versions that are managed by some central network. This not only
allows for versioning, but also means that reposities won't disappear or be moved, at least not within the same
release version.  It also means that there are actual releases; making available a tested and vetted version of
the application or library.</p>

<h3 id="last-thoughts">4 Last Thoughts</h3>

<p>There's plenty more that could be said both for and against the use of Go for your projects. I think the
<a href="#deps">dependency issue</a> may be a deal-breaker for my own projects, however different developers
and projects have different requirements.  It is certainly fast and simple to build projects in Golang, but 
I could say the same thing about Groovy. Golang has channels to simplify communication between threads, but so
does Clojure (another JVM language).  Golang is fun, and I like using it, but it's also a young language (Go 1.0 was
released on March 28, 2012). It still has some growing pains to get through. If Google decides that they want the
language to become widely adopted, they will have to fix the dependency issue.  If they don't, it will never become
an enterprise language (I know, how uncool).  If they do fix it, there could be a serious third-party contender for
the role of most popular programming language, which has been a two-man race between
<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">Java and C for the past 12 years</a>.</p>
