<p>If I'm going to be completely honest, <em>Compass</em> is by far the simplest and most complete CSS authoring 
framework.  I just have one major issue with it... Ruby.  It's not that I have a problem with Ruby as a language.  
Just the contrary, I am a fan of Ruby and Rails, and while I've used neither in a professional context, I have 
used Rails to build the occasional prototype web application. I just don't want to have to install another 
compiler on my seriously over-burdened laptop (there's a reason I run Xfce on this sucker).</p>

<p><em>{LESS}</em>, in my opinion, is even worse.  I personally think that Node.js is a fantastic idea, and I love 
playing with it, but if I'm just working on a simple website, where I am editing everything in VI, I don't want to 
install Node.js to compile a stylesheet.</p>

<p>That's when I discovered <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/">Closure</a> and 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/closure-stylesheets/">Closure-Stylesheets</a>.  They're both just executable JARs 
with no dependencies.  What could be simpler than that?  Closure to minify my Javascript files, and Closure 
Stylesheets to compile and minify my CSS files, easily available via simple command-line calls.  Because they are 
jars, I can wrap them with a Maven Plugin &mdash; oooh, there's an idea (if it hasn't been done already).  I can even 
write a Grails Resource Plugin &mdash; second fun project (update: already been done).</p>

<p>But alas, for now I simply wrote a pair of shell scripts to wrap them in the gentle embrace of the Linux command-line.  
Here's all I had to do to get this to work.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Download the JAR files and stick them someplace easy to remember.  The Javascript compiler comes bundled 
	in a TAR file so I did that one first, and unpacked it to <code>/usr/local/closure-compiler</code></p></li>

	<li><p>Create the jsminify script in <code>/usr/bin/jsmininify</code>. This script should contain the following:</p>

	<pre><code class="bash">#!/bin/bash
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    java -jar /usr/local/closure-compiler/compiler.jar --help;
else
    java -jar /usr/local/closure-compiler/compiler.jar $@;
fi;</code></pre></li>

	<li><p>Create the cssminify script in <code>/usr/bin/cssminify</code>. This script should contain the following:</p>

	<pre><code class="bash">#!/bin/bash
unknown_functions="--allowed-non-standard-function color-stop";
unknown_functions="$unknown_functions --allowed-non-standard-function -moz-radial-gradient";
unknown_functions="$unknown_functions --allowed-non-standard-function -webkit-radial-gradient";
unknown_functions="$unknown_functions --allowed-non-standard-function -o-radial-gradient";
unknown_functions="$unknown_functions --allowed-non-standard-function -ms-radial-gradient";
unknown_functions="$unknown_functions --allowed-non-standard-function radial-gradient";
unknown_functions="$unknown_functions --allowed-non-standard-function progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient";
unknown_functions="$unknown_functions --allowed-non-standard-function progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha";
unknown_functions="$unknown_functions --allowed-unrecognized-property behavior";
unknown_functions="$unknown_functions --allowed-unrecognized-property -khtml-opacity";
cmd="java -jar /usr/local/closure-compiler/closure-stylesheets.jar $unknown_functions";
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    java -jar /usr/local/closure-compiler/closure-stylesheets.jar --help
else
   java -jar /usr/local/closure-compiler/closure-stylesheets.jar $unknown_functions $@;
fi;</code></pre>

	<p>You'll notice a whole bunch of calls to <code>--allowed-non-standard-function</code> and <code>--allowed-unrecognized-property</code>. 
	These basically allow you to use the provided functions and properties, without having to specify these exceptions 
	each time you use the css compiler.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That's it. You're done. Of course you could have put those scripts somewhere on <code>/usr/local</code>, then created a 
symbolic linkage.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">ln -s /usr/local/closure-compile/jsminify.sh /usr/bin/jsminify</code></pre>

<p>It's really up to you. If I thought that I were going to swap around my implementation of jsminify, I 
would probably go that route.</p>
