<h3>Continuous Integration as the Next Step.</h3>

<p>I have worked as a consultant for quite a few years, and have landed in the middle of a number of different 
development shops, each with their own standards and tools. And some without standards or tools. For the most 
part, the Java development team at my current client is doing a fantastic job.</p>

<p>What do they already have working for them?</p>

<ul>
	<li>A code repository &hellip; <span class="highlight">&#10004;</span></li>
	<li>A build framework &hellip; <span class="highlight">&#10004;</span></li>
	<li>An artifact repository &hellip; <span class="highlight">&#10004;</span></li>
	<li>A backlog to manage defects and enhancements &hellip; <span class="highlight">&#10004;</span></li>
	<li>Separation of concerns between library and application code &hellip; <span class="highlight">&#10004;</span></li>
	<li>Integration testing &hellip; <span class="highlight">&#10004;</span></li>
	<li>Unit testing &hellip; <span class="highlight">&#10004;</span></li>
</ul>

<p>So with all of these things going right, why am I talking about Continuous Integration? 
What will this give them that they don’t already have? And what is expected of them, if 
they want to implement this correctly?</p>

<h4 id="why-ci">Why CI?</h4>

<p>Continuous Integration, or CI, is a mechanism to receive constant feedback about the status and quality 
of a development project. It informs the development team when there is a problem, and provides assurance 
to the team members who rely on common code that everything is available, stable, and safe to use.</p>

<p>When a team member commits code into trunk on the repository, the CI system will compile, test, and deploy the 
changes to the correct artifact repository. It will report and inform team members about failures, and will 
track the overall health of a project. If the code has a compilation error, or a test failure, all interested 
parties are immediately made aware (usually via email), and the problem commit is identified. In this way 
problems can be solved, transparency is realized, blocking issues are avoided, and efficiencies are gained.</p>

<h4 id="whats-the-catch">What’s the Catch?</h4>

<p>There is always a catch when implementing new frameworks and tools. If the cost of implementation is too 
onerous, than there is an opportunity to decide whether it is worth the hassle. Consider to the cost of 
switching from Ant to Maven, or implementing unit tests. The benefits are enormous, and quickly realized, but 
it would be a lie to say that it came without sacrifice. Maven robs Developers of their freedom to organize 
their projects however they choose. Unit tests take time, and a considerable amount of skill, to write. In 
comparison, continuous integration is a low cost addition to developer toolbox. The only requirements are 
things that the development team should be doing anyways.</p>

<p>The continuous integration solution should always manage the trunk of all common library projects. This 
ensures that everyone has the latest stable version of the library code. Adding branches to the CI solution 
may also be beneficial, if there are multiple developers working on the same branch.</p>

<p>The trunk should always be the latest snapshot version of project. If a Maven POM file with a release 
version (i.e. removing the -SNAPSHOT suffix) is committed into trunk, the developer has just removed the 
“continuous” from their continuous integration solution. Most artifact repositories should only accept one 
release build. This means that any subsequent builds of the same release will result in an error deploying 
to the artifact repository.</p>

<p>Developers should not commit broken code, or code with failing unit tests. This will just produce a broken 
build, and the CI will start spamming all interested parties. The build should be compiled and tested before 
the developer commits to the code repository. If the team members need to make a large number of changes 
before safely committing the code, they may consider making those changes in a branch until they are ready 
to merge into trunk.</p>

<p>Never remove or skip tests. Unit tests are important; they ensure functionality and backwards compatibility. 
Removing tests to get build to work is a game of kick-the-can. Sure the code builds in CI, but it will fail in 
production. There are brittle tests out there that may need to be fixed, but the developers must be careful 
not to change the spirit of the test.</p>

<h4 id="practice">Put Process into Practice.</h4>

<p>Practice makes perfect, and everybody breaks the build at some point. Continuous integration is not a tool 
that managers should be using to measure the performance of developers. It is not a shaming device. Organizations 
should try to have a little fun with it. I have worked for companies where the team member that broke the build 
had to buy donuts for the rest of the team. In this way the team members bonded over breakfast, nobody got mad, 
and build errors were quickly fixed.</p>
