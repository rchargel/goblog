<p>This is an update to my previous post called <a href="/blog/formatting-xml-in-vim">Formatting XML in VIM</a>. It's a
quick and easy way to format JSON documents using VIM. It makes use of Python's <code>-mjson.tool</code> feature, so make sure that
you already have Python installed on your system.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> All commands are assumed to be performed as 'root' unless stated otherwise.  If you
choose to perform this as another user, you will need to 'sudo' most of these commands.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Create a new shell script called jsonpp.sh in any directory you choose. I put mine in
	<code>/usr/local/scripts/jsonpp.sh</code>.</p></li>

	<li><p>Copy the following code to your shell script:</p>

	<pre><code class="bash">#!/bin/bash
cat $1 | python -mjson.tool</code></pre>

  <p>Make that file executable.</p>

	<pre><code class="bash">chmod +x jsonpp.sh</code></pre></li>

	<li><p>Add that file to your path through a symbolic link.</p>

	<pre><code class="bash">ln -s /usr/local/scripts/jsonpp.sh /usr/bin/jsonpp</code></pre>

	<p>At this point you already have a cool json pretty-printer that you can just call on a file.</p></li>

	<li><p>Now just modify the .vimrc file in your home directory (should not be done as root) Add the
	following to your .vimrc file:</p>

	<pre><code class="bash">:syntax enable
function! DoFormatXml()
% !xmllint % --format
endfunction
command!
FormatXml call DoFormatXml()</code></pre>

	<p>If you already did my hack for Formatting XML, here is what your .vimrc file might look like.</p>

	<pre><code class="bash">:syntax enable
function! DoFormatXml()
% !xmllint % --format
endfunction
function! DoFormatJson()
% !jsonpp % --format
endfunction
command! FormatXml call DoFormatXml()
command! FormatJson call DoFormatJson()</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Try it out: Next time you are editing a JSON file in VIM, just type the following command: <code>:FormatJson</code></p>
<p>Note: make sure the file is saved before attempting this, as the command will format that most recently saved version
	of the file.</p>
