<p>Lately, I feel that I have had to defend my choice of Ubuntu and its ilk as my operating system at 
home. After all, I'm a Linux geek, shouldn't I be running Gentoo or Slackware? As a result, I have 
compiled a list of reasons why I run Linux Mint on my laptop and Ubuntu on my desktop (the exception 
is my file server which does run Gentoo).</p>

<h4>A) Apt</h4>

<p>This is really just a personal preference. I have always preferred apt to yum. Once you learn the 
command-line for apt, it really becomes a powerful tool. Before anyone points this out, I realize 
that there are plenty of Linux distributions with apt. Even Fedora comes with apt now.</p>

<h4>B) The level of pretentiousness is slightly lower.</h4>

<p>Linux forums have become full of people who are only slightly less annoying than Mac users. I frankly 
don't care which Linux distribution you choose, or if you even use Linux. I don't proselytize any 
particular distro (and that's not my intention now), and I don't hate Windows or Mac. I don't think I 
should be lectured as to why Gentoo / Slackware / CentOS / Mandriva is the best distribution. You're 
not cool because you use Ratpoison as your GUI. Please people, chill out. If you become as bad as the 
Mac geeks, nobody will use Linux.</p>

<h4>C) I am too old for this %#&amp;$.</h4>

<p>Frankly, I like the fact that I can just run the install and everything works out of the box. I don't 
have to worry about drivers, or compiling the kernel, or dealing with screwy wireless card configuration 
files. It's installed, and it works. There's nothing like compiling and modding the kernel for learning 
the underbelly of your operating system, but I know how it works, and now I don't want to spend two days 
dealing with conf files in order to get my new laptop up and running.</p>

<h4>D) My family can use it.</h4>

<p>My girlfriend uses a Mac, and many of my friends and family use Windows. When they use my laptop, 
they don't ask me annoying questions.  It seems to be intuitive enough for both groups of users.  I 
will however admit that it is much easier for Mac users.  Windows users are annoyed by the extremely 
responsive nature of the UI. They expect to be able to take a coffee break whenever they want to open 
a new application, and they don't understand why the computer shuts down and reboots so fast.</p>

<p>This is actually no joke. While visiting my family in Virginia, my mother got worried that my machine 
shut down so fast, she thought she may have broken it.  This is a woman with a PhD and an MD, and still 
works for a living.  She is not some old lady who is still running Windows 3.1 on the 486 collecting 
dust in the den.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>I know Gnome, Ubuntu, and Mint are bloated. I know they are auto-magical, and they lack in geek 
cred. I know all these things, but please, please, shut up. I don't care what you run on 
your box, and you shouldn't care what I run on mine.</p>
